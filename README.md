# suv

suv (shared-uv) is cli tool based on uv for managing python virtual environments

## Why?

I don't like Conda, Miniconda and other similar tools. I prefer to use virtualenv and venv. But I don't like to create virtual environments in every project. I prefer to use one virtual environment for all projects. So I created suv. I like uv and it's speed. So I used uv for creating suv.
